# OWOT Room Script
This script was made mostly for fun. It allows you to create a "room" and send messages, and others can join too.
## How to host
1. Copy *host.js*
2. Position your cursor where you want it to be
3. Run the script
## How to join rooms
1. Copy *client.js*
2. Run the script
## Current issues
  - You can't host multiple rooms
  - Anonymous users can't join _(might be good though?)_
  - You can join the same room multiple times

I will try to fix these soon if I can lol.
